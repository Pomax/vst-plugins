const SAMPLE: &str = "\
# Notepad

A markdown editor that lives in your DAW. Type as you would in **Typora** —
the markdown *converts as you write it*.

## What works

- headings, at every level
- bullet lists, which continue themselves
- [x] task lists you can tick
- [ ] ...and untick
- ~~struck-through~~ text and `inline code`

1. numbered lists
2. renumber themselves
3. as they grow

> Blockquotes continue on the next line, too.

```rust
// Fenced code keeps its markdown literal.
let heading = \"# not a heading\";
```

        .map(|a| Theme::from_str(&a))
