# Markdown Notes

A VST3 markdown note-taking effect. It loads on any track in any DAW, keeps your notes in
the project file, and converts markdown as you type it — the way Typora does.

Written in Rust. (The plan asked whether Rust could do this before considering
anything else: it can. The [`vst3`](https://crates.io/crates/vst3) crate ships
complete VST3 bindings with no C++ SDK dependency, and supports both
*implementing* COM interfaces — the plugin — and *calling* them — the test host.)

## Layout

| Crate | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/crates/markdown-notes-core` | The editor: a document, WYSIWYG layout, as-you-type conversion, plugin state, file I/O. No UI, no plugin dependencies. The buffer, caret, selection and undo are [`kode-markdown`](https://crates.io/crates/kode-markdown)'s; see [EDITOR_CHOICE.md](EDITOR_CHOICE.md). |
| `src/crates/markdown-notes-plugin` | The VST3 plugin, plus the egui GUI. |
| `src/crates/markdown-notes-testrunner` | Runs scripted editing scenarios against the real plugin binary, through the mini host in `../tools/mini-host`. |
| `src/xtask` | Build tasks: assembles the `.vst3` bundle, runs the test suite. |
| `src/tools` | Screenshot helpers for the real editor window. |

The VST3 host this project tests against is a separate project:
`../tools/mini-host`, documented in [docs/mini-host](../mini-host/DEVELOPERS.md).

## Building

```bash
cargo dist
```

That leaves the installable plugin in `binaries/`, beside the tools:

```text
binaries/
  Markdown Notes.vst3
```

On Windows and Linux that is the plugin binary; on macOS it is the `.vst3`
bundle directory, which is the only form a plugin can take there. Either way it
is what gets copied into the VST3 folder:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`

This project's own result in `binaries/` is replaced by every build, so it only
ever holds the current one.

**A successful build deletes `target/`.** Everything worth keeping has been
copied to `binaries/`; what remains only helps when something went wrong, so it
survives a *failed* build and not a successful one. The trade is that the next
build is a cold one.

`cargo dist` is an alias for `cargo run -p xtask -- bundle --release`; plain
`cargo build` cannot do any of this, because cargo has no post-build hook that
can see the finished cdylib. `cargo dist-debug` builds the debug profile.

Cross-compiling for macOS uses the same task, though it needs an Apple linker
and SDK, which a Windows machine does not have — CI does this on a macOS
runner:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- bundle --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- test
```

That builds the plugin, then runs the unit tests and the scenario suite in that
order, and, since it too is a build, clears this project's result from
`binaries/` first and deletes
`target/` when everything passes. `--keep-target` leaves the build output in
place for a faster next run. The order is the point: the scenario runner loads the plugin binary at
runtime rather than linking it, so cargo has no idea the two are related and
will happily run the suite against a stale `.dll`. (The runner refuses to run
if it spots one, because that actually happened here — a deliberately broken
`process` sailed through a green suite.)

The two halves can still be run alone:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo build -p markdown-notes-plugin && cargo run -p markdown-notes-testrunner
```

The scenario runner loads the built plugin binary and drives it through the
same interfaces a DAW uses — `GetPluginFactory`, `createInstance`,
`createView`, `IPlugView::onKeyDown`, `IComponent::get/setState`. There is no
test-only backdoor: a scenario types `* milk`, Enter, `eggs` one keystroke at a
time and then reads the document back out of the state blob the plugin would
write into a project file.

To use the built plugin without a DAW — the real thing, loaded through the
factory and attached to a window:

```bash
test.bat
```

```bash
./test.sh
```

Both open `../binaries/Markdown Notes.vst3` in the mini host, which lives in `../tools/mini-host` and must be built there first.

The `snapshots` feature is opt-in because the headless renderer pulls in the
whole wgpu/naga stack: several gigabytes of build output for a plugin that
ships as 5 MB. `cargo run -p xtask -- test --snapshots` runs the pixel tests
along with everything else.

Those tests render the drawing code through a real rasteriser with no window
involved. [`tests/theme_rendering.rs`](../../markdown-notes/src/crates/markdown-notes-plugin/tests/theme_rendering.rs)
asserts on actual pixels: that light really is light, that the text contrasts
with it, and that the two themes do not look alike. They exist because the
light theme once passed every non-visual check while the window stayed black:
nothing painted the background, so egui's dark-on-light text was drawn onto a
black clear colour. Only pixels catch that.

The headless renderer proves the *drawing code* is right. To prove the *real
window* is, which is the path through baseview and OpenGL where the background
is the renderer's clear colour rather than anything egui draws, run the UI
tests: they open the plugin in the mini host and photograph it.

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/capture-window.ps1 -Exe ../binaries/mini-host.exe -Title "Mini VST Host" -Out window.png
```

`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is needed wherever unsigned scripts are blocked. It
takes `-ExeArgs` for what to launch the host with, and `-Title` to say which
window to photograph.

On macOS the UI tests photograph the window themselves, through the `Window
Shot` app in `tools/window-shot`.

The host is also a standalone tool that loads **any** VST3 plugin, not just
this one:

```bash
cd ../tools/mini-host && cargo run --bin vst3-host -- ../../binaries/Markdown Notes.vst3
```

See [the mini host guide](../mini-host/DEVELOPERS.md) for how to use it and how a
VST3 plugin is loaded.

## CI

Two workflows, because checking the code and shipping it are different jobs.

`.github/workflows/markdown-notes-ci.yml` runs on every pull request touching this project or the mini host: the full suite including
the pixel tests, on both `windows-latest` and `macos-14`, plus a
[zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh) audit of the workflows themselves.

`.github/workflows/markdown-notes-build.yml` runs on pushes to `main` that change the code.
Markdown, `docs/`, `.github/`, `LICENSE` and `.gitignore` are ignored, so
editing the workflows does not cut a release. It builds and zips both
platforms, then publishes them as a GitHub release. Before publishing, each job
loads the bundle it just built and asks the factory for its classes, so a build
that produces something no host can open fails there rather than in a DAW. Releases are numbered by how
many already exist — the first is `1`, the one after release `8` is `9`. There
is no version number and no semver; this is a product, not a library.

## Keys

| | |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+I` / `Ctrl+D` | bold / italic / strikethrough (wraps the selection) |
| `Ctrl+E` | inline code |
| `Ctrl+K` | turn the selection into a link, caret left in the `()` |
| `Ctrl+/` | toggle WYSIWYG ↔ raw markdown |
| `Ctrl+T` | cycle the theme: auto → light → dark |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | undo / redo |
| `Ctrl+O` / `Ctrl+S` / `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Open / Save / Save As |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | indent / outdent a list item |

Typing converts as you go: `* ` becomes a `- ` bullet, `-[] ` becomes a
`- [ ] ` task box, Enter continues lists and blockquotes, Enter on an empty
list item ends the list, numbered lists renumber themselves, and an opening
code fence closes itself.

## Sections

The sections are one document seen in parts, not several documents. Saving
joins every section in order; opening splits the file again at each top-level
`#`, one section per heading. Text before the first heading becomes the first
section, and a file with no headings at all opens as a single section,
unchanged byte for byte.

A section is titled by the heading it starts with, or `untitled`. Titles are
capped at the width of the string `this many words`; anything longer is cut
with `...` and shown in full on hover. Every section is that same width, so
typing a heading never shifts the strip sideways.

Click a section to switch, drag it to reorder, `+` to add one, middle-click or
right-click to close. Closing the last one empties it instead of removing it.

## Colours

Light and dark are two complete sets, in
[`colours.rs`](../../markdown-notes/src/crates/markdown-notes-core/src/colours.rs), stored in plugin
state and edited under the toolbar's gear. Neither is derived from the other.

The defaults reproduce what egui's own light and dark visuals produced before
the schemes existed, so an old project looks the same after loading.

Some of what the editor shows is drawn by egui rather than by this code —
buttons, fields, checkboxes, the scrollbar, the selection — so the scheme is
written into `egui::Visuals` in `paint_visuals` before a frame is laid out, and
read directly from the scheme everywhere the editor paints for itself.

`Rgba` holds unmultiplied channels, matching what a colour picker produces.
`egui::Color32` is premultiplied, and the two are converted at the boundary.

## Design notes

**Markdown source is the source of truth.** The parser keeps marker spans
rather than stripping them, tagging each visible or hidden. Hiding them yields
WYSIWYG; revealing the ones on the caret's line gives Typora's behaviour where
punctuation appears on the line you are editing. Raw mode just makes every
marker visible. One code path serves the GUI and the tests, and the text you
save is exactly the text you typed.

**The plugin is a single-component effect** — one COM object implementing both
`IComponent` and `IEditController`. The document is edited in the GUI but
persisted by the processor, and splitting them into two objects would mean
marshalling the whole note text through parameters or `IMessage` on every
keystroke.

**State** is JSON: notes, view mode, theme, window size, caret, and file path.
Anything that fails to parse as JSON is kept as raw note text rather than
discarded, so a malformed blob loses formatting but never the user's words.
Unknown fields are ignored and missing ones default, so a project saved before
a setting existed still opens.

**Theme** is `light`, `dark` or `auto`. `auto` is stored *as* `auto` rather
than as whatever it resolved to, so a project moved between a light machine and
a dark one follows each. Resolving it is the GUI's job: `markdown-notes-core` has no
OS dependency and instead exposes `Theme::is_dark(system_dark)`, which keeps the
decision table unit-testable without an operating system in the loop. The
system setting is polled every two seconds rather than every frame, since
reading it hits the registry on Windows and a desktop portal on Linux.

**Fonts come from the operating system; none are bundled.** egui's default set
is four typefaces and about 1.4 MB, which is a quarter of the plugin, and every
platform it runs on already has fonts. The editor starts with the system UI and
monospace faces — enough for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew and Arabic — and
when text arrives in a script those cannot draw, the font for it is fetched
from the system at that moment and added as a fallback. Nothing is captured at
build time except a list of family names; the lookup happens on the machine
running the plugin.

## Known limitations

- **Bold is drawn as a stronger colour, not a bold typeface.** egui ships no
  bold font family; this is the same approach egui uses for its own emphasis.
  Embedding a bold font would fix it properly.
- **Input ownership.** When the host has attached a window, the GUI receives
  key events natively and `onKeyDown` returns `kResultFalse` — handling both
  would type every character twice. Without a window, `onKeyDown` is the only
  input path, which is how the test host drives the plugin.
